`[00:47.900]Wherever you are,
[00:54.090]you know that I adore you
[01:01.340]No matter how far,
[01:07.610]well I can go before you
[01:14.680]If ever you need someone,
[01:21.100]what not that you need help in
[01:28.230]But if ever you want someone,
[01:34.640]you know that I am willing
[01:37.750]oh and I don't want to change you
[01:42.450]I don't want to change you
[01:45.640]I don't want to change your mind
[01:51.370]I just came across an angel,
[01:56.070]out among the danger somewhere
[02:01.120]In the stranger's eye
[02:09.210]Wherever you go,
[02:15.380]I can always follow
[02:22.580]I can feed this real slow,
[02:29.070]if it's a lot to swallow
[02:36.300]If you just wanna be alone,
[02:42.690]I can wait without waiting
[02:49.740]If you want me to let this go,
[02:56.180]I am more than willing
[02:59.670]'Cause I don't want to change you
[03:04.130]I don't want to change you
[03:07.430]I don't want to change your mind
[03:12.860]I just came across some angel,
[03:17.340]out among the danger somewhere
[03:22.620]In the stranger's eye
[03:26.430]oh and I don't want to change you
[03:30.860]I don't want to change you
[03:34.170]I don't want to change your mind
[03:39.880]I just came across some angel,
[03:44.350]out among the danger somewhere
[03:49.410]In the stranger's eye
[03:51.640]I-I've never been with anyone
[03:56.370]in the way I've been with you
[03:59.590]But if love is not for fun,
[04:02.330]then it's doomed
[04:03.860]'Cause water races,
[04:08.330]water races down
[04:15.420]The waterfalls, water races,
[04:21.910]water races down
[04:29.120]The waterfalls!
[04:31.470]and I don't want to change you
[04:35.460]I don't want to change you
[04:38.850]I don't want to change your mind
[04:44.550]I just came across some angel
[04:49.080]where there is no danger
[04:52.170]Where love has eyes,
[04:54.580]it is not blind
